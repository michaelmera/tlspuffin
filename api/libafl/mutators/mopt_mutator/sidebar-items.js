There are 2 modes for `MOpt` scheduler, the core fuzzing mode and the pilot fuzzing mode. In short, in the pilot fuzzing mode, the fuzzer employs several `swarms` to compute the probability to choose the mutation operator. On the other hand, in the core fuzzing mode, the fuzzer chooses the best `swarms`, which was determined during the pilot fuzzing mode, to compute the probability to choose the operation operator. With the current implementation we are always in the pacemaker fuzzing mode."],["StdMOptMutator","This is the main struct of `MOpt`, an `AFL` mutator.
